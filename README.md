# Raydium Pairs Volume Bot

This bot is designed to automate the distribution of SOL to multiple wallets and execute endless buy and sell swap transactions simultaneously on the Raydium platform. It leverages Solana's blockchain technology to perform these operations efficiently.

## Features

- **Automated SOL Distribution**: Distributes SOL to new wallets.
- **Endless Buy and Sell Swaps**: Performs simultaneous buy and sell transactions.
- **Configurable Parameters**: Allows customization of buy amounts, intervals, distribution settings, and more.
- **Massive Buy Mode**: Enables the configuration of multiple wallets for large-scale buy operations.
- **Sell Mode**: Gradually sells all tokens in sub-wallets through small transactions.
- **Token Pair Settings**: Configurable token mint and pool ID for swap operations.
- **Logging**: Supports adjustable logging levels for better monitoring and debugging.
